# ZUA Dashboard - Discord Bot Dashboard (MERN)

## Overview

The **ZUA Dashboard** is a full-stack **MERN** project built to manage Discord communities through a single web control panel.  
It combines core server management workflows such as **applications, support tickets, moderation, role management, and analytics** into one unified system.

The frontend is built with **React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion**, while the backend exposes bot and dashboard APIs for dynamic stats, slash commands, and community feedback.

## Features

- **Advanced Application System**: Custom forms, multiple question types, auto-approval logic, and role assignment on acceptance.
- **Intelligent Ticket System**: Button-based ticket creation, staff assignment, priorities, transcripts, and inactivity auto-close.
- **Reaction and Button Roles**: Flexible role menus with role limits, cooldowns, and gated role access.
- **Advanced Moderation**: Filters for spam/invites/profanity, warning thresholds, temporary actions, and audit support.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks server growth, member activity, command usage, and moderation trends.
- **Webhook Integrations**: External integrations for GitHub, Trello, and custom webhook events.
- **Discord OAuth2 Flows**: Dashboard login/invite routing and bot authorization support.
- **Live Dynamic Data**: Bot stats, bot info, slash commands, and testimonial/feedback data are fetched through APIs.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs
- **Database**: MongoDB
