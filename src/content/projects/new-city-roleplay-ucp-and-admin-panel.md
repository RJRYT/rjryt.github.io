# New City Roleplay â€” UCP & Admin Panel

The **New City Roleplay â€” UCP (User Control Panel)** is a web-based application built for the **New City Roleplay SA-MP server (NCRP)**.  
It provides players and admins with a robust, installable platform to manage accounts, view updates, receive push notifications, and handle in-game integrations seamlessly.  

This project is **actively maintained** and forms the backbone of the community management system for NCRP.

## Key Features

- **Discord OAuth (robust flow):** Handles idempotent callbacks and duplicate requests from TWA environments.  
- **Installable PWA / TWA:** Deep-link support with `protocol_handlers` for `web+ncrp`.  
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based auth for persistent sessions.  
- **Push Notifications:** Category-based subscriptions (`server_status`, `events`, `faction_updates`, `premium_offers`).  
- **Admin Debug Console:** Live log capture, XHR/fetch monitoring, runtime error reporting, safe evaluator, and command history.  
- **Mongo â†’ MySQL Migration Utilities:** Tools for converting legacy patch notes, roles, permissions, and routes into normalized MySQL `w_` tables.  
- **Clear App Data Tools:** Secure two-step reset for cached data and tokens.
